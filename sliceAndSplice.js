// You are given two arrays and an index.

// Using the slice() function we can create an exact replica of arr2 and assign the result of the operation to a variable, copyArr.
// Now that we have an array that we can mutate on, we can iterate through every item in the first array using a for loop. For each 
// item in the first array we use the splice() function to insert the item into index n of localArray.
// We increment the index n by one. This will ensure that every item from the arr1 is inserted into copyArr in the proper index position.
// Finally, we return the localArray to end the function.


// The slice() method extracts a section of a string and returns it as a new string, without modifying the original string.
// str.slice(beginIndex[, endIndex])


// The splice() method changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements.
// array.splice(start[, deleteCount[, item1[, item2[, ...]]]])
// Note: This method changes the original array.
